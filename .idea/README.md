## Purpose:
The result of this Project aims at demonstrating the acquired skills during the first<br>
half of the Summer Semester, 2025.

It consists of a Web platform, in which data is dynamically fetched and stylistically<br>
displayed. It allows the programmer to develop skills such as making a website<br>
responsive, dynamic, and pleasing for the user.

The Web platform serves to provide the user with satisfying dynamic elements,<br>
while enriching him with information about some of the greatest miracles of history,<br>
ranging from incorrupt saints to bleeding Hosts!

## Usage

This web was well-designed so that it provides an enjoyable experience to users<br>
accessing it from their device, whatever this may be. In other words, this website<br>
is *responsive*. So no need to fetch a laptop to enjoy it!

Furthermore, this web is composed of some *dynamic elements*. When you access<br>
the website, you will see that only six cards are displayed. This is on purpose,<br>
so that the user is not thrown all the data at once!

Each card has a button labeled **"More Info"**. When pressed, this button extends the<br>
card so that more information regarding that miracle is displayed. Take advantage<br>
to learn about such great treasures of the faith!

At the bottom of the 6 initially-displayed cards, you will see a **"Load More"** button.<br>
This button will keep displaying 6 more miracles until it displays all of them.

Hope you enjoy and learn more about our faith!

## Credits

I asked ChatGPT for:
- help in setting the background image properly (what background functions to use)
    - told me: `background-size: cover;`
- a visual comparison between rem, em, %, and px.
    - told me what each one means, and how some are responsive while others are not.
- how clamp function works, and what vw is
    - the `clamp` function has 3 parameters: `minimum`, `preferred`, and `maximum`.
    - `vw` is viewpoint width (based on width of browser's viewpoint)
- the reason why I had padding on the left side of the screen
    - told me I had to change the body's margin-left to 0.
